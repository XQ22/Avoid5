# #1 - Trains

A train is a form of transportation consisting of a handful of boxcars on a rail. Typically, a motor-box pulls said boxcars to construct a chain of boxcars. A distinct option is motorisation of all boxcars, thus all boxcars aid in driving this full train.

At first, trains' clout was from boiling H2O using wood, oil, or coal. This H2O thus thrusts pistons, and said pistons start driving disks and making our train go forward.

Nowadays, trains join an AC grid for clout. In this situation, AC is moving into our train, via an additional rail or a high cord, and thus is driving our train's motors, thus turning our train's disks, and making it go forward.

A distinct option is to put a distillation of oil into our train for burning. In this situation, a combustion box burns said oil distillation, thus driving pistons, and thus, pushing our train forward.

Additional options for pushing trains forward can consist of: gravity, cord-winch, and DC from a group of Cu-Zn slabs with lithium-ions amongst said slabs.
