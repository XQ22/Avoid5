Industry is how all of us, as a world, can construct many goods to our gain. Industry is split into four groups: Obtaining stuff, Manufacturing stuff, Trading stuff, and a Fourth industry typically with short caption "R&D".

Obtaining stuff, also known as "primary industry", is an industry focusing on acquiring raw parts, such as wood, rocks, and fruit. Its product can go to manufacturing.

Manufacturing industry inputs raw parts, and is using labour to add worth to said parts, thus constructing a good surpassing its parts' quality. This industry's product can go to trading.

A trading industry buys and hawks products of manufacturing industry, hoping to gain a profit.

A fourth industry, that of improving products and tracking said products' purchasing. This industry was built as modish calculating apparatus was commonly turning up in working grounds.
